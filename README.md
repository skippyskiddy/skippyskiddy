Hi there! 

📕 I'm currently pursuing an MSCS at Northeastern University, having previously worked as a product marketing manager. I believe I bring valuable insights into the world of softeare dev as a career switcher with years of professional experience in graphic design, marketing, and project management.

💻 My current programming foundation includes Python, Java, and C with a strong proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles through a variety of academic & hobbyist projects.

⭐ I'm excited to take on new challenges and leverage my diverse experience in the tech industry. I'm currently seeking experience to accelerate my growth, apply my existing skills, and gain invaluable hands-on experience as a SWE-to-be. 


Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities. Thanks for stopping by!
