Hi there! 

📕 I'm currently pursuing an MSCS at Northeastern University, with a unique background as an ex-product marketing manager in the tech industry. As a career switcher, I bring valuable insights and a fresh perspective to the world of software development with my professional background in graphic design, marketing, and project management.

💻 My current programming foundation includes C, Python, and Java, with a strong proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles through a variety of academic projects. I hope these projects showcase my adaptability, determination, and potential to contribute in my new career path.

⭐ Driven by a passion for AI, B2C platforms, and IoT, I'm excited to take on new challenges and leverage my diverse experience in the tech industry. I'm currently seeking experience to accelerate my growth, apply my existing skills, and gain invaluable hands-on experience as a SWE-to-be. 




Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities. Thanks for stopping by!
