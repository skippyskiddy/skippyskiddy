Hi there! 

📕 I'm currently pursuing an MSCS at Northeastern University, having previously worked as a product marketing manager. I believe I bring valuable insights into the world of softeare dev as a career switcher with years of professional experience in graphic design, marketing, and project management.

💻 My current programming foundation includes Python, Java, and C with a strong proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles through a variety of academic & hobbyist projects.

⭐ I'm currently seeking experience to accelerate my growth as a SWE by applying my existing skills through hands-on experience.  


Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities that you think I'd be suitable for. Let's collaborate - thanks for stopping by!
